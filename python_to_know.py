# What are the high level differences between Python 2 and 3? 

# One thing you must understand is that as long as the version, 
# supports the libraries you want to use, you can use either of them

# What are some differences: 
#############################################

#Print


#1. print function was changed to wrapping the 
# printable objects within a parantheses 
# end = option to print more text on the same line 

#Division 

# 2. A slight change in the division operation: 
# which allows decimal answers

# to make it compatible for Python 2, in Python 3 it's 
# best to still use the decimal version for the divisor or 
# dividend or use float

# Unicode - there's UTF-8 and 2 byte classes in byte and 
# byte array's 

# Strings are now UTF-8 


#3. range() in Python 3 is implemented like xrange()
# for creating iterable objects 


#4. Raising exceptions must be in parantheses in Python 3

# 5. Handling Exceptions: where the as keyword must be used 
# - 


# 6. for loop variables no longer leak into global namespace 
# variables again 

# 7. List comprehensions have similar syntactic sugar similar 
# to generator expression inside a list 


# 8. A TypeError is changed when we try to compare unorderable 
# types in 

#9. Input in Python 3 always reads input() as strings
